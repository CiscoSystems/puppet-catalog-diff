A tool to compare 2 Puppet catalogs.

While upgrading versions of Puppet you want to ensure that
no unexpected changes will be made prior to doing the upgrade.

This tool will allow you to diff catalogs created by different
versions of Puppet.  This will let you guage the impact of a
Puppet upgrade before actually touching any of your nodes.

This is roughly the version of the code that works, it's not
clean code or tested throughly, as I use it to do upgrades in
the near future there will no doubt be refinements.

Validation Process:

 - Grab a catalog from your existing machine running the old version
 - Copy it locally and run:

      dumplocalconfig.rb --format yaml fqdn.yaml

 - Configure your new Puppet master, copy the facts from your old master
   to the new one
 - Compile the catalog for this host on the new master:

      puppet master --compile fqdn > fqdn.pson

 - Copy the catalog over and run:

      dumplocalconfig.rb --format pson fqdn.pson

 - At this point you should have a dump directory with 2 different catalogs
   to compare them run:

      diffcatalogs.rb dump/0.24 dump/2.6


Future Improvements:

 - Allow specifying output names so you can compare 2 catalogs produced
   with the same version of puppet
